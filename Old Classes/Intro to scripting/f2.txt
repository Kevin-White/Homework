Moreover, the emergence of various services and applications, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and intelligent
transportation, require efficient and real-time data collection
and data processing. To address these challenges, storage,
and computation resources expects to be provisioned to end
devices in proximity, giving birth to mobile edge computing (MEC) [5]â€“[8]. Consequently, with the aid of MEC, the
demands from end devices can be served locally and quickly,
rather than being served by the remote cloud through backhaul. In other words, through decentralizing cloud service and
spreading the burden of cloud servers in core networks to base
stations (BSs), the requests for both contents and computations
can be satisfied locally, which significantly mitigates the pressure on core network and reduces the service latency for end
devices.
