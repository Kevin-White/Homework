MEC poses many challenges in terms of deployment and
resource management [9], [10]. By incorporation of storage
and computation resources in networks, it is of importance
yet very challenging to utilize various forms of resources
in an efficient way to meet different usersâ€™ needs. For the
time-varying requests from end devices, it is found that the
requests may exhibit certain similarity among different users
over time. The same popular contents may be requested at similar locations in different time instants. Therefore, as presented
in [11], and [12], proactively caching reusable contents, such
as video streams and high-resolution images during off-peak
periods and reusing cached content in peak hours, can reduce
traffic loads in backhaul and service latency of end users so
that the QoE [13] can be improved [11], [14]. For computation
requests, some computation applications and data can also be
stored such that the response can be made promptly for tasks
from users [15].
